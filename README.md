# Markdown Equation Insert Plugin for Vim

This plugin helps inserting LaTeX equation into markdown file as gif image
generated by [latex.codecogs.com](latex.codecogs.com). All you need to do is to
**invoke the keybinding `<LocalLeader>ee`. Then type in your equation in
`LaTeX` format**. And the equation will be automatically translated into
[latex.codecogs.com](latex.codecogs.com) recognized image generating API and
inserted under your cursor. **Invoking the same keybinding under existing
equation will enable you to edit it in `LaTeX` format.**

Note that this plugin is written in Python, hence `+python` version of Vim is
required.

## Motivation

Inputing math equation into markdown file can be troublesome sometimes as there
is no standard method of it. So far the most fail-proof method to make
generally recognized(by [github](github.com), etc.) equation is to use a third
party API to translate $LaTeX$ code into equation image, then generate a link
to that image. However, typing the link according to the api in markdown
hyperlink format is cumbersome. To facilitate the process in Vim editor, I made
this plugin.

## How to Install

Use your plugin manager of choice.

- [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
  - `git clone https://github.com/ron89/md_insert_equation.vim ~/.vim/bundle/md_insert_equation.vim`
- [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)
  - Add `Bundle 'ron89/md_insert_equation.vim'` to .vimrc
  - Run `:BundleInstall`
- [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)
  - Add `NeoBundle 'ron89/md_insert_equation.vim'` to .vimrc
  - Run `:NeoBundleInstall`
- [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
  - Add `Plug 'ron89/md_insert_equation.vim'` to .vimrc
  - Run `:PlugInstall`

## How to Use

 * To insert a new equation, invoke the function by command `:EditEquation`, or
   keybinding `<localleader>ee`, then type in the equation in direct `LaTeX`
   syntax, e.g.
```
    \alpha \frac{a}{b}
```

   Output would be automatically translated into an image link:
```
    ![eqn](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\alpha\\times\\frac{\\beta\ a}{b+\\gamma})
```
   and on github, the asserted link shall appear as ![eqn](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\alpha\\times\\frac{\\beta\ a}{b+\\gamma}).

 * To edit an existing equation, invoke the same function/keybinding when cursor is on an existing equation link.
